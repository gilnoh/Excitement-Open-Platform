		// - How can I put my annotations in Target? (some code)
		// - How should I put my Link in CAS? (again some code)
		// - How can I iterate all Links?
		// - How can I check my Links are properly added to CAS, as expected by EDAs? (LinkProber, just as LAPCasProber)
		// - How can I access my annotations back from FSArray[Annotation] within Target? (e.g. not just Annotation instance, but back to, say, Dependency, Token, etc)
		// - How can I access who have annotated this?
		// - Getting "unique" full ID for a Link instance?
